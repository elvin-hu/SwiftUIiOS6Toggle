# SwiftUI iOS 6 Style Toggle

<img align="top" src="preview.gif" width="340">

Please do not use this toggle in a "serious" project. 

I created this to demonstrate how far the drawing and graphics tools in SwiftUI can be pushed and what can be accomplished, but doing so brings forward many issues like accessibility concerns, etc.
