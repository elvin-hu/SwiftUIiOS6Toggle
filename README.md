# SwiftUIiOS6Toggle

<img align="left" src="preview.gif" width="280">
iOS 6 style toggle implemented with SwiftUI

Please do not use this toggle in a "serious" project. 
I created this to demonstrate how far the drawing and graphics tools in SwiftUI can be pushed and what can be accomplished, but doing so brings forward issues like accessibility, etc.
